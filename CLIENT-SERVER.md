How a request gets served in client server architecture?

first of all we have to know what is client and server so,


Client: A client is a program that runs on the local machine requesting service from the server. A client program is a finite program means that the service started by the user and terminates when the service is completed.

Server: A server program is an infinite program means that when it starts, it runs infinitely unless the problem arises. The server waits for the incoming requests from the clients. When the request arrives at the server, then it responds to the request.



In the client server architecture, when the client computer sends the request for data to the server through the internet, the server accepts the requested process and deliver the data packets requested back to the client. client do not share any of their resources, for example: email, world wide web etc.
