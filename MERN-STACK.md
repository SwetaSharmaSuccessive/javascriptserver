MERN Stack: MERN Stack is a javascript stack that is used for easier and faster deployment of full stack web applications.Mern stack consists of technologies namely: MongoDB, Express, React, and node.js.
These powerful technologies provides an end to end framework for the developers to work in and each of these technologies play a major part in the development of web applications.

Getting to know MERN Stack components:

1 MongoDB: Cross-platform document oriented
MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JavaScript Object Notation objects.
MongoDB is flexible and allows its users to create schema, databases, tables, etc.

uses of MongoDB:

-fast

-scalability

-use of javaScript

-Schema Less

-simple environment setup


2 Express: Back-End Framework

Express is a Node.js framework. Rather than writing the code using Node.js and creating loads of Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code.

uses of Express:

-Asynchronous and Single-threaded.

-Effecient, fast & scalable

-Has the biggest community for Node.js

-Express promotes code reusability with its built-in router.

-Robust API


3 React: Front-end library

React is a JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces. React is used for the development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data.

uses of React:

-Virtual DOM: A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object.

-JSX: JavaScript XML. It is an HTML/XML JavaScript Extension which is used in React.

-High Performance

-Developing Android/Ios Apps.


4 Node.js: JS runtime environment

Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server (outside the browser). Node pack manager i.e. npm allows the user to choose from thousands of free packages to download.

uses of Node.js:

-Open source JavaScript Runtime Environemnt.

-Single threading: Follows a single threaded model.

-Data Streaming.

-Fast: Built on Google Chromeâ€™s JavaScript Engine, Node.js has a fast code execution.

-Highly Scalable.
